This project demonstrates how to train the **YOLOv9** object detection model on a custom dataset using a Kaggle notebook. In this project, I have used the latest Yolov9 model to predict Bangla Sign Language from images. I have trained the Yolov9 model with around 9000 images of different Bengali Sign language and classified them into 49 distinct classes. Below is a summary of the key steps involved. 

### YOLOv9 Model with Custom Dataset Training

This project demonstrates how to train the **YOLOv9** object detection model on a custom dataset using a Kaggle notebook. Below is a summary of the key steps involved:

1. **YOLOv9 Repository Cloning**:
   - The official YOLOv9 repository is cloned from GitHub, bringing in all the necessary files required to work with the model.

2. **Downloading Dataset**:
   - The **gdown** package is installed and used to download a custom dataset (a large ZIP file) from Google Drive directly to the Kaggle notebook environment.

3. **Unzipping the Dataset**:
   - The dataset ZIP file is extracted into the YOLOv9 directory for model training. The original ZIP file is deleted after extraction to save storage space.

4. **Downloading Dataset Configuration (YML file)**:
   - A custom YML file, which specifies dataset paths and other training parameters, is downloaded to the YOLOv9 directory.

5. **Installing YOLOv9 Dependencies**:
   - Required dependencies like **ultralytics** and other libraries are installed to set up the environment for YOLOv9 training.

6. **Final Steps**:
   - With the dataset and configurations in place, the YOLOv9 model is trained and evaluated on the custom dataset.
